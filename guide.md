How I made it?
 1. I firstly downgraded my python version to python 3.11 to support the python library MetaTrader5
 2. Then I installed all the necessary libraries like streamlit pandas numpy MetaTrader5 scikit-learn plotly 
 3. Then started grinding with the code error after error but still had faith it will work of which one of the errors 
was indentation most of the time and in the terminal downgrading my python version at times as well as upgrading my pip 
version to support librarires like ta
 4. Then in order to run the python file since we are using streamlit we type: streamlit run ultimate_forex_trading_platform.py
 5. Finally ensure you have Meta Trader 5 insalled in your computer and click on connect to Mt5 in the python website.
